Dayong is dedicated to helping Discord servers build and manage their communities.

- Multipurpose —lots of features, lots of automation.
- Self-hosted and easy to deploy —just a few more steps to take.
- Free and open-source —tinker with it, and feel free to contribute to its improvement!
- Modular —easily add extensions and features.

> For setup and installation instructions, please refer to the [documentation](./docs).
