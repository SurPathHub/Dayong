## Installation

Download the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/SurPathHub/Dayong.git
```

## Bot Account Setup

Follow the instructions here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

## Project Setup

1. Go to the project root directory.

    ```
    cd Dayong
    ```

2. Create a copy of `.env.example`. Don't forget to omit the `.example` at the end.

    On Linux and Unix
    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    On Windows
    ```
    copy .env.example .env
    ```

3. Edit the `.env` file and add your credentials to the corresponding variables.

4. Install [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation). Check if poetry is installed by running `poetry --version`.

5. Run `poetry shell`. This will create or start the virtual environment.

6. Run `poetry install`. This will install the project and its dependencies.

## Usage

1. From the project root directory, run:

    ```
    python dayong
    ```

2. Open your Discord application. Go to the server where you invited the bot and run `[your command prefix]help`. For instance: `.help` or `!help`. The dot prefix is the default.

## Welcome Message for New Member

1. Modify the welcome message by changing the value(s) of the following in `Dayong\dayong\embeddings.json`.
    ```
    "greetings_channel":"<channel name where the greetings will be prompted>",
    "readme_channel_id": <id of the channel you want to tag>,
    "description": "<your greetings>",
    "color": <integer value of the color you want to use>

    "greetings_field": {
        "<n>": {
            "name": "field's name"
            "value": "field's value"
        }
        , ...
    }
    ```
> You can have as many as `greetings_field`s you want. However, make sure that its inner key(s) is an integer (starting with 0) since it will be used inside a `for` loop.
